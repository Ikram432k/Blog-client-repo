                    <p>Motivation only exists as a noun. But discipline has a verb form. In other words, discipline is something you do, and choose to do; motivation is a thing that can come and go, which you cannot choose to do or control. If there’s something in your life you want to change — large or small — utilize your newfound motivation to decide on a new action you’re going to take daily that will help you to change that thing.</p>
